          "In this stage, your baby is learning how to coordinate their senses with their body movements. As a result of this, they will try to touch, taste, smell, bang, and throw anything and everything everywhere. To prevent them from getting sick, sanitize everything they have in reach and don't discourage them a lot. There are a few reflexes you should know about to help your baby. The first is to stroke your baby's cheek lightly to make them turn towards you ready to be fed (rooting). The second is to place something on their palm to make them grip it (gripping). The third is a sudden noise or a feeling of falling startling them and causing them to start crying (Moro). The last one is stroking the bottom of their feet to spread out the toes (Babinski). During this time, your child is going through many critical periods where they learn how to do certain things. If they don't learn this early enough, they may not be able to learn it well. Also, every baby goes through these stages in this order: bringing hands to mouth, turning over, banging things together, sitting up, crawling, picking things up between fingers, walking, and running. They will also start adapting to new things and reduce their reaction the more times they experience it. Your baby is developing lots of neural connections in their brain and learning lots of things.
