As a result of this, they will try to touch, taste, smell, bang, and throw anything and everything everywhere. To prevent them from getting sick, sanitize everything they have in reach and don't discourage them a lot. There are a few reflexes you should know about to help your baby. The first is to stroke your baby's cheek lightly to make them turn towards you ready to be fed. The second is to place something on their palm to make them grip it. The third is a sudden noise startling them and causing them to start crying. The last one is stroking the bottom of their feet to spread out the toes. ",
